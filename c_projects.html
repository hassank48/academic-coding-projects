    <h1>Hassan's C and MIPS Assembly Projects (from CMSC216)</h1>
    <p>Fall 2023 Semester - Course Instructor: Larry Herman</p>

    <h2>Check Lines</h2>
    <p>I practiced the use of standard library I/O functions and event trees to check for lines of code that violate style guidelines for any input file.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Blueberry Crisp</h2>
    <p>Practiced bit masking that converts machine language into assembly instructions for a fictional processor and vice versa.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Makefiles</h2>
    <p>Created makefiles that used proper dependencies, macros, and style.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Walrus</h2>
    <p>I familiarized myself with C structs, unions, and pointer arithmetic.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Dynamic Memory Allocation</h2>
    <p>I practiced dynamic memory allocation with structs and data, prevented any sort of memory leaks, and used C string library functions.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Priority Queues and Lists</h2>
    <p>Continued to use structs to create linked data structures that simulated priority queues and lists of priority queues while using dynamic memory allocation and preventing memory leaks.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Process Control</h2>
    <p>Practiced process control concepts like forking, standard I/O, input/output redirection, and exec functions.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Submit Server</h2>
    <p>Created a functional submit server from scratch which uses process control, piping, I/O redirection, and makefiles to compile and test student code.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Assembly</h2>
    <p>Converted C programs into MIPS assembly instructions.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Threads</h2>
    <p>Practiced concurrency with PThreads.</p>
    <hr>
