        <font size="5">Check Lines<br></font>
        I practiced the use of standard library I/O functions and event trees to check for lines of code that violate style guidelines for any input file. <br>
        <font size="5">Blueberry Crisp<br></font>
        Practiced bit masking that converts machine language into assembly instructions for a fictional processor and vice versa. <br>
        <font size="5">Makefiles<br></font>
        Created makefiles that used proper dependencies, macros, and style. <br>
        <font size="5">Walrus<br></font>
        I familiarized myself with C structs, unions, and pointer arithmetic. <br>
        <font size="5">Dynamic Memory Allocation<br></font>
        I practiced dynamic memory allocation with structs and data, prevented any sort of memory leaks, and C string library functions. <br>
        <font size="5">Priority Queues and Lists<br></font>
        Continued to use structs to create linked data structures that simulated priority queues and lists of priority queues while using dynamic memory allocation and preventing memory leaks. <br>
        <font size="5">Process Control<br></font>
        Practiced process control concepts like forking, standard I/O, input/output redirection, and exec functions. <br>
        <font size="5">Submit Server<br></font>
        Created a functional submit server from scratch which uses process control, piping, I/O redirection, and makefiles to compile and test student code. <br> 
        <font size="5">Assembly<br></font>
        Converted C programs into MIPS assembly instructions. <br>
        <font size="5">Threads<br></font>
        Practiced concurrency with PThreads.
