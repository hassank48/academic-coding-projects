# academic-coding-projects

NOTE: Under the University of Maryland's Code of Academic Integrity and Honesty, I cannot share code directly from academic projects as they risk plagiarism from other students. Hence, I will do my best to list the key concepts learned, used, and practiced with repetition in each project, as well as each project's function(s).
