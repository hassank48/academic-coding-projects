# academic-coding-projects

NOTE: Under my university's strict Code of Academic Integrity and Honesty, I cannot share code directly from these projects as they risk plagiarism from other students. Hence, I will do my best to list the key concepts learned, used, and practiced with repetition in each project, as well as each project's function(s).
