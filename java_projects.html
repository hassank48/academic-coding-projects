    <h1>Hassan's Java Projects (from CMSC132)</h1>
    <p>Some GUI's and advanced software were not my work, but the work of my course instructor Fawzi Emad. However, all concepts listed below were my own code and did not use outside assistance.</p>

    <h2>Blackjack Simulator</h2>
    <p>I practiced the use of ArrayLists, enumerations, logic, classes, and interfaces in order to make a functional Blackjack simulator.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>BasicLinkedList</h2>
    <p>I used Node structures, parametrized types, and iterators to make my own functional linked list.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>MyHashSet</h2>
    <p>Used an array of Node linked lists to create my own Hash Set/Table.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Minimum Snippet</h2>
    <p>Using iterators, I replicated a search engine feature that finds a sequence of words/letters across pages/documents with no regard for order.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Binary Search Tree</h2>
    <p>Used interfaces, objects, and event trees in order to create a functional binary search tree.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Maze Graph</h2>
    <p>Used hashmaps and search algorithms (Depth and Breadth First Searches and Dijkstra's) to create weighted graphs and solve intricate mazes and find their optimal weighted paths.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>HeavyBag</h2>
    <p>Used hashmaps to create a data structure that can hold large amounts of duplicate objects optimizing performance.</p>
    <hr>
