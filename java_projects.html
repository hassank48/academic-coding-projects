   		Some GUI's and advanced software were not my work, but the work of my course instructor Fawzi Emad. However, all concepts listed below were my own code and did not use outside assistance.

      <h2>
        <font size="5">Blackjack Simulator</font>
      </h2>
      <p>
        I practiced the use of ArrayLists, enumerations, logic, classes, and interfaces in order to make a functional Blackjack simulator. 
      </p>
      <h3>
        <font size="5">BasicLinkedList</font>
      </h3>
      <p>
        I used Node structures, parametrized types, and iterators to make my own functional linked list.
      </p>
      <h4>
        <font size="5">MyHashSet</font>
      </h4>
      <p>
        Used an array of Node linked lists to create my own Hash Set/Table.
      </p>
      <h5>
        <font size="5">Minimum Snippet</font>
      </h5>
      <p>
        Using iterators, I replicated a search engine feature that finds a sequence of words/letters across pages/documents with no regard for order. 
      </p>
      <h6>
        <font size="5">Binary Search Tree</font>
      </h6>
      <p>
        Used interfaces, objects, and event trees in order to create a functional binary search tree.
      </p>
      <h7>
        <font size="5">Maze Graph</font>
      </h7>
      <p>
        Used hashmaps and search algorithms (Depth and Breadth First Searches and Dijkstra's) to create weighted graphs and solve intricate mazes and find their optimal weighted paths.
      </p>
      <h8>
        <font size="5">HeavyBag</font>
      </h8>
      <p>
        Used hashmaps to create a data structure that can hold large amounts of duplicate objects optimizing performance.
